# Summary of Fixes - October 27, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issue 1: Schedule Deletion Not Working

**Problem:** When admin toggled off flag ceremony and confirmed deletion, the schedule was not actually deleted despite showing success message.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added explicit deletion of all related records before deleting the schedule
- Added detailed logging to track deletion process
- Order of deletion:
  1. Attendance records for that date
  2. Required teachers
  3. Required students  
  4. Notifications for that date
  5. Finally, the attendance schedule itself

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(tabs)/schedule.tsx` - `confirmFlagDayToggleOff` function

**Testing:**
1. Login as admin
2. Create a flag ceremony schedule
3. Toggle flag ceremony OFF
4. Confirm deletion
5. Check that schedule is removed from calendar
6. Reload page - schedule should stay deleted

## ‚úÖ Issue 2: Notification Badge Cropped on Home Screen

**Problem:** The notification count badge on the avatar (circle icon) was being cropped because of `overflow: hidden` on the avatar container.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `avatarContainer` from `overflow: 'hidden'` to `position: 'relative'`
- Improved badge positioning and styling:
  - Better top/right positioning (-6, -6)
  - Added shadow for visibility
  - Improved text centering
  - Badge now fully visible outside avatar circle

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Styles section

**Visual Result:**
```
Before:          After:
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê        ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  üë§  ‚îÇ3       ‚îÇ  üë§  ‚îÇ [3]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
(cropped)       (fully visible)
```

## ‚úÖ Issue 3: Device Push Notifications

**Problem:** Notifications only showed in-app, not on the user's device notification tray.

**Solution Implemented:**

### A. Database Setup
Created two new migration files:
1. **`database/20250127_push_tokens.sql`**
   - Stores device push tokens for each user
   - Links user_id to their device token(s)
   - Supports multiple devices per user

2. **`database/20250127_notifications.sql`** (already existing)
   - Fixed foreign key constraint issue
   - Changed `schedule_id UUID` to properly reference `schedule_date DATE`

### B. New Files Created

1. **`hooks/usePushNotifications.ts`**
   - Automatically registers device for push notifications
   - Requests permission from user
   - Gets and saves Expo push token to database
   - Handles notification events (received, tapped)

2. **`utils/pushNotifications.ts`**
   - Utility function to send push notifications
   - Fetches push tokens from database
   - Sends to Expo Push Notification API
   - Handles batch sending to multiple users

3. **`PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_SETUP.md`**
   - Complete setup guide
   - Installation instructions
   - Testing procedures
   - Troubleshooting tips

### C. Integration

**Modified Files:**
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Added `usePushNotifications()` hook
- `app/(tabs)/schedule.tsx` - Added push notification sending logic

**How It Works:**

1. **User Opens App (Any Role)**
   - `usePushNotifications` hook activates
   - Requests notification permission
   - Gets Expo push token
   - Saves token to `push_tokens` table

2. **Admin Creates/Edits Schedule**
   - Selects required students/teachers
   - Clicks "Save Schedule"
   - System compares with previous requirements
   - Detects added/removed users

3. **Notifications Sent (Dual System)**
   - **In-App**: Saved to `notifications` table
   - **Push**: Sent to Expo Push API ‚Üí User's device

4. **User Receives Notification**
   - **Foreground**: Alert banner in app
   - **Background**: Notification in device tray
   - **Closed**: Notification in device tray
   - **Do Not Disturb**: Queued and delivered when available

5. **User Interaction**
   - Tap notification ‚Üí Opens app
   - Badge count updates automatically
   - Can view details in Notifications screen

### D. Notification Messages

**Type 1: Attendance Required** üìã
- Title: "üìã Attendance Required"
- Body: "You are required to take attendance on [Date]!"
- Color: Green indicator

**Type 2: Attendance Not Required** ‚ÑπÔ∏è
- Title: "‚ÑπÔ∏è Attendance Update"  
- Body: "You are not required to take attendance on [Date]."
- Color: Red indicator

### E. Installation Required

```bash
npx expo install expo-notifications expo-device
```

Then run both SQL migrations in Supabase.

**Important Notes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Push notifications **ONLY work on physical devices**
- ‚ùå Will NOT work on iOS Simulator or Android Emulator
- ‚úÖ Use `npx expo run:android` or `npx expo run:ios` for testing
- ‚úÖ Notifications bypass Do Not Disturb mode (device specific)
- ‚úÖ Works even when app is closed

## Production Considerations

For production deployment:
1. Configure FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) for Android
2. Configure APNs (Apple Push Notification service) for iOS  
3. Build production apps with EAS Build
4. Test thoroughly on multiple physical devices
5. Monitor notification delivery rates

See `PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_SETUP.md` for complete production guide.
