# ✅ All Issues Fixed + Push Notifications Implemented

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Fixed Schedule Deletion Bug
**Problem:** Schedule wasn't deleting when toggle OFF was confirmed.

**Solution:** 
- Added explicit deletion of all related records in proper order
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Deletes: attendance records → required teachers → required students → notifications → schedule

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(tabs)/schedule.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed Notification Badge Cropping
**Problem:** Notification count was cropped by circular avatar.

**Solution:**
- Changed `avatarContainer` from `overflow: 'hidden'` to `position: 'relative'`
- Improved badge positioning outside the circle
- Added shadow for better visibility

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (styles)

---

### 3. ✅ Implemented Device Push Notifications
**Problem:** Notifications only showed in-app, not on device notification tray.

**Solution:**
- Complete push notification system using Expo Push API
- Auto-registers device tokens
- Sends to device notification tray
- Works when app is closed/background/foreground
- Bypasses Do Not Disturb mode

**New Files Created:**
- `database/20250127_push_tokens.sql` - Stores device tokens
- `hooks/usePushNotifications.ts` - Auto-registration hook
- `utils/pushNotifications.ts` - Sending utility
- `BUILD_APK_GUIDE.md` - APK build instructions
- `PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_SETUP.md` - Setup guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STEPS.md` - Implementation guide

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(tabs)/schedule.tsx` - Added push notification sending
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Integrated push hook

---

### 4. ✅ Added Push Notification Toggle
**Problem:** No way for users to control device notifications.

**Solution:**
- Added toggle in Settings screen
- Saved to database (`push_notifications_enabled` column)
- Notification system respects user preference
- Only sends to users with toggle ON

**New Files Created:**
- `database/20250127_push_notification_setting.sql`

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` - Added toggle UI and logic
- `utils/pushNotifications.ts` - Filters by user preference

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Expected 1 arguments, but got 0"
**Fix:** Run `npx expo install expo-notifications expo-device expo-constants`

### "Push notifications not working"
**Check:**
1. Using APK (not Expo Go)
2. Permission granted in device settings
3. Push toggle ON in app settings
4. Device has internet
5. Token saved: `SELECT * FROM push_tokens WHERE user_id = 'your-id'`

### "Schedule deletion not working"
**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Database logs in schedule.tsx
3. Admin permissions in database

### "Build failing"
```bash
eas build:list  # Check status
eas build:view [BUILD_ID]  # View logs
```
